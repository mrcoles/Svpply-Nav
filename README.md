Svpply-Nav
==========

I was particularly taken with the beauty of the Svpply Navigation Elements and set out to mimic it in javascript.

This was originally in my portfolio site, http://www.herdingpixels.com, built in Wordpress. I've extracted it from there as best I could.

The navigation is also set up to load ajax content painlessly.

Any questions, drop me a line!
